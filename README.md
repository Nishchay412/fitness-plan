# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# AI Fitness Planner

AI Fitness Planner is a web-based fitness planning application designed to help users create personalized workout and nutrition plans. By leveraging artificial intelligence, the app tailors each plan to the user's fitness goals, body type, experience level, and preferences. It aims to provide an all-in-one fitness solution that adapts to your needs over time, ensuring continuous progress and improvement.

## Features

- **Personalized Workout Plans**: Generate custom workout plans based on your fitness goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain, endurance) and experience level (beginner, intermediate, advanced).
- **Nutrition Guidance**: Receive tailored meal suggestions that align with your fitness goals and dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, keto, high-protein).
- **AI Recommendations**: The app uses AI to adapt workout intensity and nutrition plans as you progress, ensuring that your regimen evolves with your fitness level.
- **Progress Tracking**: Log your daily workouts and meals, and track your progress with detailed analytics and charts.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean, easy-to-use interface built with modern web technologies for a smooth user experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **AI Integration**: TensorFlow.js or other AI/ML libraries (depending on your implementation)
- **Hosting**: Deployed using platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or AWS.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: Users provide basic information, such as fitness goals, current fitness level, height, weight, dietary preferences, and available equipment.
2. **AI-Generated Plan**: Based on the user input, the AI engine creates a personalized workout and nutrition plan.
3. **Progress Adaptation**: As the user logs workouts and meals, the AI continuously analyzes their performance and adjusts future plans to maintain optimal results.
4. **Tracking and Feedback**: The app provides feedback on performance, offering insights into progress and areas of improvement.

## Key Components

### Workout Plan Generation
The AI engine generates a custom workout plan that includes exercises, sets, reps, and rest periods, tailored to the user’s body type, fitness goals, and available equipment.

### Nutrition Plan Generation
Along with the workout plan, the AI recommends meal options, including macronutrient breakdown (protein, fats, and carbs), caloric intake, and daily meal schedules.

### Progress Tracking
Users can track their daily workout performance, log completed exercises, and record meal consumption. The app tracks progress over time, offering visual representations of how the user's strength, endurance, or weight has improved.

### AI-Powered Adjustments
The AI continually refines plans based on logged data, ensuring that each user's workout and nutrition plans evolve as they progress, ensuring the regimen remains challenging and effective.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nishchay412/ai-fitness-planner.git
cd ai-fitness-planner
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run Locally

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed to run the backend.
- **MongoDB**: Set up a MongoDB instance to store user data.
- **API Keys**: Configure any necessary AI or external API keys (e.g., for advanced fitness algorithms or food database integration).

## Deployment

The app can be deployed to any modern cloud platform. You can use services like:

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for frontend deployment.
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for backend deployment.

## Future Enhancements

- **Workout Demonstrations**: Include video demonstrations for exercises.
- **Community Feature**: Users can share their progress and motivate each other through social interaction.
- **AI Chatbot**: A virtual fitness assistant that provides real-time advice and motivation.
